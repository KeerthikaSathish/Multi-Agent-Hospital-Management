1.	Absence Agent: Handles doctor availability, considers absences, and includes emergency backup doctors.
2.	Assignment Agent: Assigns patients to doctors based on specialization and preferred doctor.
3.	Backup Agent: Redirects patients if the assigned doctor is unavailable.
4.	Reporting Agent: Generates a daily schedule report in CSV format.
